[chapter *.afc output layout test]

In order for you to test your stylesheets, here is a test page for the *.afc format layout.

It includes all the displayed tags of the Tubaina syntax. Go on, try your own layout on it (our's works)!

[section Chapters, sections and other chunks]

This just allows us verify if the sections are correctly working and so are its paragraphs and stuff like
that.

It is kind of important to verify paragraph spacing.

[title unimportant section]

This section should appear on the same html page as the section "Chapters, sections and other chunks"

[quote To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion -- Anonymous ]

Not labeled text, [label A simple label! No tag is allowed here]Labeled text[/label].

[box A sample box] This should be contained in a box and all the kinds of code tag in it. Let's see...

**Java:**
[java]
public static void main (String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Hello world!");
}
[/java]

**XML:**
[xml]
<printIt when="now">
	Hello world!
	<skipLine />
</printIt>
[/xml]

**Code:**
[code]
int main(){
	printf("Hello world!\n");
}
[/code]

**Code properties:**
[code properties]
print: "Hello world!"
jumpLine= 1 line
[/code]

Check if there is no weird color background on the codes above. If there is, you should use the *.css tag:

[code properties]background-color: inherit[/code]
[/box]

[title Code chunk outside boxes]

Now we're testing the Code chunks outside the boxes - just to make sure you didn't messed it all up when
fixing the stylesheets for boxes. Besides, we're testing the lines highlight on all the code types, 
boldening the printing lines on each format.

**Java:**
[java h=2]
public static void main (String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Hello world!");
}
[/java]

**XML:**
[xml h=2,3]
<printIt when="now">
	Hello world!
	<skipLine />
</printIt>
[/xml]

**Code:**
[code h=2]
int main(){
	printf("Hello world!\n");
}
[/code]

**Code properties:**
[code properties h=1,2]
print: "Hello world!"
jumpLine= 1 line
[/code]

[title Exercises]

The exercise tag enumerates the exercises. Pay attention to that.

Furthermore, the answer tag should create either a dropdown tab, on HTML, or a answer booklet at the end of
the Latex output.

[exercise]
	[question] The question 
		[answer] The answer [/answer]
